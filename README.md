##Main Challenges
The original project was a game impired but the board game Risk, however, after 3 days of development, we realised that was not possible to reach and MVP in time for the end of the project week. For this reason, 4 days before the deadline, we changed completely the project idea trying to using as much as possible from the existing code.

With the previous project, apart for the complexity, one of the main challenge that we had to face was the implementation of **Fusion Layers**, a experimental feature of **Google Maps API**.
